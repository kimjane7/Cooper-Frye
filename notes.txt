different particles have different average velocity, they flow differently

hydro does not assume this, so we have to build interface between two descriptions: hydro & cascade (smooth & lumpy)

hypersurface (3D) is the boundary between hydro and cascade (4D) ALL AT SAME FREEZE OUT TEMPERATURE

hypersurface has dimensions of volume (area*time) AND direction

dOmega_mu = d^4x partial_mu-Theta(C(x)), C(x)=Tf-T(x)
          = d^4x delta(Tf-T(x)) partial_mu-T(x)

partial_mu = partial/partialx^mu
r^alpha = (t,x,y,z)
r_alpha = (t,-x,-y,-z)
r^2 = r^alpha*r_alpha
p^alpha = (E,px,py,pz)

example: E_alpha = -partialV/partialx^alpha

amount of charge that comes through hypersurface Delta Q = integral d^4x delta(Tf-T(x)) partial_mu-T(x) j^mu(x)
current density j^mu(x)

goal: want to make particles

chance of making particle at given time is proportional to "all this"

j^mu_hadronspecies = integral d^3p/(2 pi hbar)^3 f(pvec,x) (p^mu/E) Theta(p dot Omega)
f(pvec,x) = exp(-(E-mu)/T)/(1+- exp(-(E-mu)/T)) = exp(-pu/T)/(1+- exp(-pu/T)) <--- at freeze out temp!
E^2=p^2+m^2

p^mu/E is velocity

number of hadrons that goes through hypersurface = Delta Omega_mu j_h^mu

MONTE CARLO

say i have a file of hypersurface elements locations
make particles after summing over hypersurface elements

boost invariance = we're in an area that eta changes so slow that you can assume eta is constant

Pratt changed how he does 2D:

DeltaOmega_mu = integral d^3x integral dt partial_mu T delta(T-Tf), where delta(T-Tf) = delta(t-t_s(rvec))/(partial T/partial t)
              = Deltax Deltay Deltaz partial_mu T/(partialT/partialtau) <--- denominator can be zero if temperature is staying constant at freeze out Tf

for each hypersurface element, pick x, y, z, or t such that gradient in that direction is the biggest

DeltaOmega_0 = Deltax Deltay Deltaz
DeltaOmega_1 = Deltay Deltaz Deltat ((T(t,x+dx/2)-T(t,x-dx/2))/(T(t+dt/2,x)-T(t-dt/2,x))


1/velocityofsurface = partialx T/ partialE T
